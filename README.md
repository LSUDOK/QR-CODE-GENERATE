# QR Code Generator 🖋️📱
This project demonstrates how to generate QR codes efficiently using Python. QR codes are widely used for sharing information like URLs, text, Wi-Fi credentials, and more. This implementation leverages the qrcode Python library for seamless QR code creation.

Features 🚀
Generate QR codes for any text, URL, or data.
Save QR codes as image files (e.g., PNG, JPG).
Simple and user-friendly implementation.
Installation 🔧
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/qr-code-generator.git  
cd qr-code-generator  
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
The project uses the following libraries:

qrcode
pillow (for image processing)
Usage 📖
Run the script using:

bash
Copy code
python qr_generator.py  
Enter the data you want to encode in the QR code when prompted.

The QR code image will be generated and saved in the project directory.

Code Explanation 💡
The core functionality revolves around:

Importing the qrcode library for QR code creation.
Accepting user input for data to encode.
Using qrcode.make() to generate the QR code.
Saving the generated QR code as an image file.
Here's a snippet of the code:

python
Copy code
import qrcode  

# Data to encode  
data = "https://example.com"  

# Create QR code  
qr = qrcode.QRCode(version=1, box_size=10, border=5)  
qr.add_data(data)  
qr.make(fit=True)  

# Generate and save image  
img = qr.make_image(fill_color="black", back_color="white")  
img.save("qrcode.png")  
Future Enhancements 🌟
Add a GUI for user-friendly interaction.
Include customization options (color, size, logo embedding).
Integrate with web frameworks for online QR code generation.
